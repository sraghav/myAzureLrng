    "4. Steps 2 and 3 are repeated until a stopping criteria is met. Typically, the algorithm terminates when each new iteration results in negligible movement of centroids and the clusters become static.\n",
    "5. When the clusters stop changing, the algorithm has *converged*, defining the locations of the clusters. Note that the random starting point for the centroids means that re-running the algorithm could result in slightly different clusters, so training usually involves multiple iterations, re-initializing the centroids each time, and the model with the best WCSS (*within cluster sum of squares*) is selected.\n",

The divisive method is a \"top down\" approach starting with the entire dataset and then finding partitions in a stepwise manner. Agglomerative clustering is a \"bottom up\" approach. In this lab you will work with agglomerative clustering which works as follows:\n",

    "5. Steps 3 and 4 are repeated until all data points are in a single cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "The linkage function can be computed in a number of ways:\n",
    "- *Ward* linkage measures the increase in variance for the clusters being linked.\n",
    "- *Average* linkage uses the mean pairwise distance between the members of the two clusters.\n",
    "- *Complete* or *maximal* linkage uses the maximum distance between the members of the two clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Several different distance metrics are used to compute linkage functions:\n",
    "- *Euclidean* or *l2* distance is the most widely used. This metric is only choice for the Ward linkage method.\n",
    "- *Manhattan* or *l1* distance is robust to outliers and has other interesting properties.\n",
    "- *Cosine similarity* is the dot product between the location vectors, divided by the magnitudes of the vectors. Note that this metric is a measure of similarity, whereas the other two metrics are measures of difference. Similarity can be quite useful when working with data such as images or text documents.\n",
